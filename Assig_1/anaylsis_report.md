Results

Average Heart Rate (HR): 81.59 bpm

Average PPI (ms): 735.40 ms

PPI Standard Deviation (SD): 27.20 ms

RMSSD: 38.15 ms

Interpretation of Results

Was the average heart rate low or high?

The average heart rate (81.59 bpm) is within the normal range (60–100 bpm) but slightly elevated, indicating possible mild activity or stress.

Was the average PPI low or high?

The average PPI (735.40 ms) falls within the normal range (600–1000 ms), suggesting regular heart rhythm.

How much variation was there in the PPI values?

PPI standard deviation (27.20 ms) and RMSSD (38.15 ms) indicate low variability in the intervals between heartbeats.

Was the variation low or high?

Both SD and RMSSD values are slightly on the lower side, suggesting reduced heart rate variability.

Recovery and/or stress level of the patient:

The reduced HRV (low SD and RMSSD) may indicate stress, fatigue, or insufficient recovery.

Conclusion

The patient has a normal average heart rate and peak-to-peak interval. However, the heart rate variability is slightly reduced, which may indicate a state of stress or limited recovery. Further context, such as activity level or health status, would help refine the interpretation.
